                            <h4> An ongoing update...</h4>
                            <h4>08/01/2023</h4>
                            <p>I currently code on VS Code, but due to working around the country I had a couple of options - I could either use Git and do a pull everytime I get to a new computer (think laptop/office desktop/home desktop) or I could find a way to code remotely that wasn't as awful as remote accessing the screen of my home PC. </p>
                            <p>I then realised that the VS Code team had been working hard on generating remote working packages - and that I could make that work. I didn't want to just connect to the desktop back at home, I was looking for a solution that would let me connect in, work in a container so that the requirements for that project were clear and known and do it from anywhere - including Starbucks or Costa with an iPad !</p>
                            <p>I therefore refactored an old PC and installed a hypervisor - I went for Proxmox. </p>
                            <p>On Proxmox I installed a Debian Virtual Machine (I chose Debian since Proxmox is Debian based as well) and on that I installed VS Code and setup Remote Access.</p>
                            <p>That works OK, but the VS Code Containers extension will not work with the Remote extension - it will work with the SSH extension. I therefore setup port forwarding for SSH into the VM, and connected via SSH with full docker container support inside VS Code from any coffee shop I choose !</p>
                            <p>Now that's a pretty cool way to work !</p>
                            <p>Proxmox also gives me the change to roll up servers and shut them down for testing - so I installed Docker inside a container with Portainer for managing the longer term Docker enviroments and solutions that I wanted running. This lets me start a server, test, change, edit, adjust and get things right before I roll anything out to the cloud.</p>
                            <p>Also... thanks to Costa for fuel'ing my code... albeit with Breakfast Tea...</p>
