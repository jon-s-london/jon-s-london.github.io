                            <h4>23/06/2022</h4>
                            <p>This was a Python/Flask/HTML/CSS/sqlite3 project. It was also the final project for the Harvard CS50 course I completed. </p>
                            <p>The goal of the project was to provide ongoing monitoring for automated machinery 24/7 when no staff where present. The data was checked for suitability, stored in a database and then checked routinely with 'alarms' being raised for any points that staff should look at when next available.  </p>
                            <p>The project code worked well - unforunately the incoming data was from a suppliers software which created CSV's that python then read. This software was deemed too unreliable and the supplier is working on an API system to replace it. </p>
                            <p>A v2.0 of this project is likely once that API is supplied and available as alot of value was added via this tool.</p>

                            <h4>21/08/2022</h4>
                            <p>This program is a time saving tool developed to take customer reports and batch sort them. Reports arrive in excel format, but with empty rows at the top of the worksheet, empty rows in the middle of the data and the data is formatted with headings on the left hand side.</p>
                            <p>The excel sheet is designed to be read from this document - but over a month there are hundreds or ever thousands of pieces of valuable data available - being able to use put the information together and then use tools like Excel or Power BI adds value to the data and turns it into information.</p>
                            <p>A Python CLI tool was developed to take the data, delete the un-needed rows and load it into a Pandas Dataframe before sorting and amending the data to a 'master document' that builds over time.</p>
                            <p>This led the information flow within the business to improve, the data to show the return on investments that had been made and analysis on trials to be conducted within minutes rather than hours of painstackingly manipulating and sticking together excel documents.</p>

                            <p>It is intended to show the work that I am progressing on and the area's that I am interested in - due to the role of the site it was not required to be dynamic but I have plans to impliment other sites in future that will have that requirement.</p>
                            <p>Previous to this build, I used a small amount of HTML for a Harvard CS50 project and dabbled back in c.2000 but have never built a full site from scratch.</p>
